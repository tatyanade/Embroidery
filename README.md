# Using the Embroidery Machine


*illustrations grabbed from machine [manual](Manual.pdf)*

## Turning on the Machine

![diagram of right side of the machine](./images/machine_power.png)

Plug the power cord into the power socket (A), located on the right side of the machine. Once it's plugged in, you can turn the machine on using the power switch (B) 


## Preparing the Machine for Embroidery

In this section, we will go over how to prepare the machine for embroidery. You will want to do this with the machine *off*. This will require us to attach the embroidery unit, and the embroidery foot, and optionally an embroidery needle.

### Changing the Needle
*make sure the machine is off*

You will need to change the needle if the needle is broken, or if you need to switch between an embroidery needle and sewing needle. Note that both work in embroidery mode, but the embroidery needle is less prone to fraying or breaking the thread.

![Changing the needle](./images/changing_the_needle.PNG)

Loosen the needle screw with the screwdriver, this will allow you to pull the needle out through the bottom. Once it's out, you can insert the new needle upwards with the flat side away from you. Push it all the way up, and then tighten the needle screw with the screwdriver

### Changing the foot
*make sure the machine is off*


With the power off, remove the current foot.

### Changing the Unit
*make sure the machine is off*

#### Overview
This is the embroidery unit, it holds the embroidery hoop in place and allows the machine to move the hoop in the x and y directions.

#### Removing a Unit
If there is a different unit currently attached to the machine, you will want to remove it by sliding it out.

![0_remove_sewing_unit.PNG](./images/0_remove_sewing_unit.PNG)

remove the sewing unit (or other unit) by sliding it left.


#### Attaching the Embrodiery Unit
![0_slide_in.gif](./images/0_slide_in.gif)

Attach the embroidry unit by sliding it into location - it will snap into place.


## Preparing to Embroider



### Preparing the Bobbin

#### Refilling a Bobbin

##### Winding the Bobbin Horizontally

1. Place the felt pad and thread spool on the spool pin in horizontal position. Slide on a spool cap of the right type and direction.

2. Place the thread under the thread guide (A) from right to left. Pull the thread to the rear and around the thread guide (B) from left to right, then around thread guide (C) and into the notch (D).

3. Pull thread to the right and then through the thread guide (E) from front to back. Pass thread under tension disc (F) in clockwise direction. 
Note: Make sure the thread is pulled securely inside the tension disc
for correct thread tension.

4. Thread through the hole in the empty bobbin (G) from the inside to the outside.

![winding_bobbin](./images/bobbin_loading_onto_machine.PNG)

5. Place the bobbin on the bobbin winder spindle. 

6. Push the bobbin spindle to the right to wind. A pop-up appears on the screen to inform you that bobbin winding is active. Press the start/stop button to start winding the bobbin. Hold the end of the thread firmly when starting to wind. When the bobbin is full, press the start/stop button again to stop. Push the bobbin spindle to the left. The pop-up closes. Remove the 
bobbin and cut the thread using the bobbin thread cutter
(H).

*Note: When winding the bobbin from auxiliary spool pin, do not hook
thread to the guide (C) and notch (D).*


#### Loading the Bobbin

*Make sure the needle is fully raised and the machine is turned off before inserting or removing the bobbin.*


![loading_bobbin](./images/load_bobbin.PNG)

**Note: Be sure that the bobbin is inserted with the thread wound counterclockwise**

1. Open the bobbin cover by pushing the release button to the right (A). Remove the cover (B). 
2. Insert the bobbin in the bobbin case with the thread running in a counterclockwise direction. 
3. With a finger held gently on top of the bobbin, pull the thread into notch (C). Then pull the thread at arrow
markings into the needle plate thread guide from (C) to (D). Pull the thread at the arrow markings into the needle
plate thread guide from (D) to (E). To cut off excess thread, pull thread to the right, over the blade (E).
4. Replace the bobbin cover



### Getting the Hoop Ready

#### Hoop Overview

![0_hoop.png](./images/0_hoop.png)
1. Embroidery hoop connector
2. Outer hoop
3. Inner hoop
4. Quick release
5. Retaining screw
6. Center marks

#### Preparing the Hoop

![0_hoop_prep.png](./images/0_hoop_prep.png)


To put the fabric into the hoop, place the outer hoop on the table,open the quick release (A) and loosen the screw (B). Put the fabric backing and fabric on top of the hoop, with the fabric on the topmost. Then, place the inner hoop on top of the fabric, and press it firmly into the outer hoop. Close the quick release, and turn the screw until the fabric is secured firmly. The fabric should be taut for best results.

#### Attaching and Removing the Hoop 

![Slide hoop on or off](./images/hoop_on_off.png)

Slide the hoop connector into the hoop attachment (A), it will click into place. You will need to raise the presser foot past the raised position to make sure the hoop can fit underneath. To remove the hoop from the embroidery arm, press the grey button (B) on the hoop attachment and slide the hoop towards you.



## Machine Basics 

### Raising/Lowering the Presser Foot

![Slide hoop on or off](./images/adjust_presser_foot.PNG)

The presser foot is lowered or raised with the presser foot lift, it is raised when lifted up (A), and lowered when pushed down (B) . The presser foot can be raised higher (C) to make it
easier to slide the the embroidery hoop into location.

### Raising/Lowering the Needle

![handwheel](./images/handwheel.PNG)

Turn the Handwheel (A) to raise or lower the needle manually.


# Embroidering

## Saving a File
*note that the Husqvarna Viking can only read .vp3 files*

Once you have a file ready to embroider, plug the USB into your laptop and save your file within the desired folder.

## Starting an Embroidery

### Opening a File
![USB port](./images/usb_port.png)

To open a file, plug the USB into the embroidery machine, then turn the machine on.
#### Setting the Hoop Size

![hoop_options_button](./images/hoop_options_button.png)

Once you have loaded your file, the first thing you will need to do is set the hoop size. Do this by pressing the hoop options button (A).

![hoop_options](./images/hoop_options.png)

Select the hoop size you are planning on using, if a specific size is unselectable, that means your design is too big to fit on it.



#### Resizing the Design

![resizing](./images/resizing.png)


You can increase or decrease the size of the deisgn up to 20%. Use the first set of + and - (1) to adjust the height, and the second set of + and 0 (2) to adjust the width. Each press of a button scales by 5%. The stitch count remains the same throughout resizing.


#### Rotating and Mirroring the Design

![mirror or rotate](./images/rotate_mirror.png)

To rotate the design around its center point, press the rotate button (B). This will rotate the design 90 degrees clockwise. If the design is to large to rotate by 90 degrees, the rotate button will rotate it 180 degrees.

The Mirror buttons, (A) and (C), will mirror the design horizontally and vertically.

#### Placing the Design

![controls for_placing](./images/placing_design.png)

*note that pressing OK will NOT start embroidering, but will recenter your design on the screen*

You can use the 4 arrow keys to move your design around and determine where on the fabric it will be embroidered. You can use the **Corner Check** button (1) to preview the size by having the machine trace the corners of your design so you can see the actual size and placement of your file.



### Start Embroidering!

*Before you start embroidering, make sure that the bobbin has enough thread to finish your design, as you cannot replace it without restarting the embroidery*

to start the embroidery, press the Stop/Start button. follow directions of the screen.

### While Embroidering...

#### Rethreading the needle

The thread may break while you are embroidering. If it does, the machine will stop and ask you to RETHREAD the needle.

#### Changing Color for Multicolored embroideries

If you're design has multiple colors, the machine will stop after it is done with one color section, and ask you to switch thread. To do this, remove the spool and rethread the machine with the new desired color.

### Finishing the embroidery

When the emboridery is done, the screen will let you know. Cut the thread and Remove the hoop. Open the hoop and take out the embrodiery
